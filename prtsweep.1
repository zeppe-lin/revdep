.SH NAME
prtsweep \- sweep old files from the ports directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B prtsweep
[\-a] [\-d] [\-n] [PORTDIR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fIprtsweep\fP program sweeps port directories from unneeded files.
Unneeded files are either files which are not part of the source array 
in the Pkgfile or package files with a name like 
.PP
.nf
	name#version.pkg.tar.gz
.fi
.PP
All other files are removed. If a port directory is empty, the whole directory
can be removed with the \fI\-d\fP option. Even old package files can be removed
with the \fI\-p\fP option.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.I "\-a"
This is the automatic mode. In this mode \fIprtsweep\fP reads the ports
directories from the rsync and httpup files in /etc/ports and cleans all ports 
in these directories.
.TP
.I "\-d"
Removes empty directories completely. This happens when ports are moved for
example from unstable to stable or vice versa. Note that this option only
deletes empty directories, so accidently removing whole directory trees
should not happen, even if you use
.IP
.nf
	prtsweep \-d /
.fi
.IP
To remove these moved ports completely you have to run \fIprtsweep\fP twice
to first remove the files and second remove the empty directory.
.TP
.I "\-n"
Dryrun. Do not remove anything really.
.TP
.I "\-p"
Removes also pkgfiles. Only the newest pkgfile is kept in the
ports directory.

.SH EXAMPLES

You can call \fIprtsweep\fP with one port:
.PP
.nf
	root@hostname:/root # prtsweep /usr/ports/opt/dialog
	=======> /usr/ports/opt/dialog
	+ removing file dialog-0.9b-20020814.tgz
.fi
.PP
Or you could call the automatic mode, which scans your supfiles in /etc/ports
for all ports directories and cleans them automatically:
.PP
.nf
	root@hostname:/root # prtsweep -a
	=======> /usr/ports/clc/stable/atop
	+ removing file atop-1.8.tar.gz
	=======> /usr/ports/clc/stable/coldsync
	+ removing file coldsync-2.2.5-gcc3.diff
	+ removing file coldsync-2.2.5.tar.gz
	=======> /usr/ports/clc/stable/dnsmasq
	+ removing file dnsmasq-1.10.tar.gz
	...
.fi
