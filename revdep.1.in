.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrevdep\fP checks for missing libraries of installed packages using elfutils'

.SH EXAMPLE
Try this command to list broken packages:
.PP
$ \fBrevdep\fP
.PP
Use this command to rebuild packages on your system:
.PP
# pkgman update \fB-fr\fP $(\fBrevdep\fP)

.SH ADDITIONAL LIBRARY DIRECTORIES
Upon startup, \fBrevdep\fP searches the /etc/revdep.d directory for files named
after packages. If any are found, any directories (assumed to be absolute
paths and delimited by newlines) within the file are added to a list of
package specific directories to search if a library dependency is not found
in one of the many standard locations (as specified by \fBld.so\fP(8)).
.PP
If a package is discovered to have library dependencies that are in a
non-standard location, then a file, as specified above, should be created.
.PP
For example, if the package "firefox" has a "libxul.so" dependency in a
the non-standard directory "/usr/lib/firefox" then a file named "firefox"
should be created under "/etc/revdep.d" with a single line containing
"/usr/lib/firefox". This will tell \fBrevdep\fP where to find firefox's "libxul.so"
when looking for its library dependencies, reducing one source of false
positives. Ideally, this file would be included with the package's own packaging
as well.
