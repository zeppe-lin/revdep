.SH NAME
prtverify \- utility to check CRUX ports for typical errors 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBprtverify [options] <port> ...\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBprtverify\fP is a shell script which calls gawk with a bunch of 
small modules, each of them containing one or more tests.

The following tests are implemented:

.TP
.B port
 - missing files Pkgfile/.footprint/.md5sum
 - invalid files/directories (-m clean-repo option)
.TP
.B Pkgfile
 - existence of name/version/release/source variables
 - existence of Description/Maintainer/URL headers
 - empty Description/Maintainer/URL headers
 - invalid email address in Maintainer header
 - match of portname to name variable
 - wrong release number
 - cd/rm command outside the work directory
 - use of non-ASCII characters
 - missing dependencies (-m missing-deps option)
.TP
.B .footprint
 - world writable files/directories
 - junk files like perllocal.pod
 - invalid directories like /usr/info
 - invalid users
 - files not owned by root
 - SUID/SGID files
 - permission collisions with directories provided by core/filesystem
 - file-conflicts with other ports (-m file-conflict option)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -l <loglevel>
All tests are categorized into 4 levels, from FATAL to INFO, which
can be used to adjust the output of prtverify.
Set loglevel to 8 for INFO, 4 for WARN, 2 for ERROR and 1 for FATAL
errors. Sum them up to show combined loglevels, e.g. 12 for WARN
and INFO errors. The default is 15, which shows all error messages.
.TP
.B -m clean-repo
If this mode is set, an additional test for invalid files
like *.pkg.tar.gz or invalid directories like .svn is selected.
Only sensible for clean repositories, of course.
.TP
.B -m missing-deps -c <path_to_collection> [-c <path_to_collection> ...]
Adds a test for missing dependencies. The test takes the arguments set 
by the 'Depends on'-header and looks for a complying directory in the 
path specified by the -c option. Multiple -c options are allowed.
.TP
.B -m file-conflict -c <path_to_collection> [-c <path_to_collection> ...]
Adds a test for file-conflicts with other ports. The ports .footprint
entries are compared with a list of files from the ports specified
with the -c options.

\fBNote:\fP the test is very time-consuming if you run it over a large 
number of collections !
.SH WHITELIST
To avoid messages for errors which are known and accepted \fBprtverify\fP 
uses one or more whitelists to hide those. 
The whitelists are located at \fI/usr/lib/prtverify/*.wl\fP.
